## SFML-Planet-defender

This is a semester-end project I made for Object Oriented Programming

## Introduction

This is a 2D game about defending your planet from a onsalught of deadly asteroids. I made this as my semester end project for OOP using C++ and the SFML library for low-level access to hardware components.

## About SFML

SFML or “Simple and Fast Multimedia Library” is a multi-platform (Windows, iOS, and
Linux) and multi-language (C, C++, Java, Ruby, etc.) library that provides us with an interface
to access the components of our PC. These include keyboard and mouse inputs, audio, graphics,
and network. These features allow us to develop games and Multimedia applications.

## About the game

Planet Defender is a space-themed video game in which the players take on the role of a fighter
pilot who must protect the asteroid shield of their planet, from an onslaught of deadly asteroids.

The game is easy to learn, but very fast paced, so it provides a immersive and challenging
gameplay experience. The players must learn to use their quick reflexes to destroy the asteroids
and avoid them for survival.

During the gameplay, the players control the spaceship using the keyboard. The are equipped
with a powerful weapon and a shield for the planet. The objective is to shoot down the incoming
asteroids before they collide with the planet causing damage. The player must balance the
health of their ship and the planet to survive until help arrives. The game loop is infinite and
the difficulty scales linearly. They will encounter faster asteroids as time progresses.

_Heath pools_

- The player has a distinct HP bar
- The enemies chage color as they take damage and eventually die
- The shield at the bottom of the screen also changes color as it runs out of energy until it eventually fails as well

_Ways the game can end_

- Either the player's HP reaches zero.
- Or the shield runs out of energy.

## Conclusion

I did not use a mainstream game engine like Unity or Godot as I wanted the learn the basic foundations and nuances of game development.
